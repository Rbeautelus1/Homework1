Monthly Sales Tax (10 pts)
A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales 
for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that 
asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash 
register (that is, sales plus sales tax). Assume the state sales tax is 4 
percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.

If the tota l amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 6 percent, 
the amount of product sales may be calculated as 
S=  T/1.06

Where S is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales tax). 
The program should display a report as the following:

Month: August 2022
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Total Collected:	      $  26572.89
Sales:			      $  25068.76
Country Sales Tax:           $  501.38
State SalesTax:                $  1002.75
Total Sales Tax:	      $   1504.13
